Harness is a comprehensive CI/CD platform that streamlines software delivery for modern enterprises. It provides a powerful and user-friendly interface for managing software releases, deployments, and rollbacks.

You can interact with the Harness platform through the Harness UI. 
It is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, while also providing robust features and capabilities for managing software releases.

Organisation:
What is an organization?
Harness organizations (orgs) allow you to group projects that are related and share the same goals. 
For example, all projects for a business unit or division.

You can create multiple organizations within an account. 
Any resource that you create within the organization's scope is available for use in all the projects created within this organization.



Projects:
A Harness project is a group of Harness modules, their pipelines, and resources.
For example, a project might have a Harness CI pipeline to build code and push an image and a Harness CD pipeline to deploy that image to a cloud platform.
